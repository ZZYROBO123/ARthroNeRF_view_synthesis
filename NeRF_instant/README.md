# Modified Instant Neural Graphics Primitives
The rendering part we modify based on original [Instant Neural Graphics Primitives](https://github.com/NVlabs/instant-ngp)
## Training without tracking
To train without tracking, follow the instructions in the README.md of the original [Instant Neural Graphics Primitives](https://github.com/NVlabs/instant-ngp) 
## Training with tracking
Before proceeding, ensure you can compile the original Instant-ngp by following the instructions below, which are modified from the original but necessary to compile our version.

### Building instant-ngp (Windows & Linux)

#### Requirements

- An __NVIDIA GPU__; tensor cores increase performance when available. All shown results come from an RTX 3090.
- A __C++14__ capable compiler. The following choices are recommended and have been tested:
  - __Windows:__ Visual Studio 2019 or 2022
  - __Linux:__ GCC/G++ 8 or higher
- A recent version of __[CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit)__. The following choices are recommended and have been tested:
  - __Windows:__ CUDA 11.5 or higher
  - __Linux:__ CUDA 10.2 or higher
- __[CMake](https://cmake.org/) v3.21 or higher__.
- __(optional) [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.7 or higher__ for interactive bindings. Also, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- __(optional) [OptiX](https://developer.nvidia.com/optix) 7.6 or higher__ for faster mesh SDF training.
- __(optional) [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/)__ for DLSS support.


If you are using Debian based Linux distribution, install the following packages
```sh
sudo apt-get install build-essential git python3-dev python3-pip libopenexr-dev libxi-dev \
                     libglfw3-dev libglew-dev libomp-dev libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev
```

Alternatively, if you are using Arch or Arch derivatives, install the following packages
```sh
sudo pacman -S cuda base-devel cmake openexr libxi glfw openmp libxinerama libxcursor
```

We also recommend installing [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) and [OptiX](https://developer.nvidia.com/optix) in `/usr/local/` and adding the CUDA installation to your PATH.

For example, if you have CUDA 11.4, add the following to your `~/.bashrc`
```sh
export PATH="/usr/local/cuda-11.4/bin:$PATH"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/cuda-11.4/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
```


#### Compilation

Begin by cloning this repository and all its submodules using the following command:
```sh
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/nvlabs/instant-ngp
$ cd instant-ngp
```

Then, use CMake to build the project: (on Windows, this must be in a [developer command prompt](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/building-on-the-command-line?view=msvc-160#developer_command_prompt))
```sh
instant-ngp$ cmake . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
instant-ngp$ cmake --build build --config RelWithDebInfo -j
```

If compilation fails inexplicably or takes longer than an hour, you might be running out of memory. Try running the above command without `-j` in that case.
If this does not help, please consult [this list of possible fixes](https://github.com/NVlabs/instant-ngp#troubleshooting-compile-errors) before opening an issue.

If the build succeeds, you can now run the code via the `./instant-ngp` executable or the `scripts/run.py` script described below.

## Build and Run
After successfully running the original version, follow these steps to set up and run the modified version with tracking functionality:

1. Set up the NDI and modify the ROM file in `run_modify.py`.
2. Navigate to the NeRF_instant directory and run the script:
``` sh
$ cd NeRF_instant
$ python scripts/run_modify.py
```
